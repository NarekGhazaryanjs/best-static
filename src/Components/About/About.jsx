                Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet 
                (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing 
                the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications 
                (or just 'web apps') electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list
                 of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design,
                  web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, 
                  web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
                   Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main non-design 
                   aspects of building web sites: 
                writing markup and coding. Most recently Web development has come to mean the creation of content
                 management systems or CMS. These CMS can be made from scratch, proprietary or open source. 
                 In broad terms the CMS acts as middleware between the database and the user through the browser.
                  A principle benefit of a CMS is that it allows non-technical people to make changes to their web
                   site without having technical knowledge.

For larger organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist of hundreds 
of people (web developers) 
and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing websites. 
Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer,
 or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems
  technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain
   of a designated department. There are three kinds of web developer specialization:
    front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers deal with 
    the layout and visuals of a website, while back-end developers deal with the functionality
     of a website. Back-end developers will program in the functions of a website that will collect data.
     Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use their website to sell products and services to customers.[1]

There is open source software for web development like BerkeleyDB, GlassFish,
LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost
 of learning web development to a minimum. Another contributing factor to the
  growth of the industry
 has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, 
 BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio. Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) 
 or of programming languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can be learned
  and implemented quickly with the help of help files, technical books, internet tutorials, 
  or face-to-face training.

An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers
 build more dynamic and interactive websites. Further, web developers 
 now help to deliver applications as web services which were traditionally
  only available as applications on a desk-based computer. This has allowed
   for many opportunities to decentralize information and media distribution.
    Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud,
     Dropbox and Google Docs. These web services allow users to interact with applications from many
      locations, instead of being tied to a specific workstation for their application environment.

Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led by web development
 include e-commerce. Online auction sites such as eBay have changed the way consumers 
 find and purchase goods and services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com
  (among many others) have transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting experience for many consumers.
   Another example of transformative communication led by web development is the blog.
    Web applications such as WordPress and Movable Type have created blog-environments
     for individual websites. The increased usage of open-source content management 
     systems and enterprise content management systems has extended web development's 
     impact at online interaction and communication.

Web development has also impacted personal networking and marketing. Websites are 
no longer simply tools for work or for commerce, but serve more broadly 
for communication and social networking. Web sites such as Facebook and 
Twitter provide users with a platform to communicate and organizations 
with a more personal and interactive way to engage the public.
